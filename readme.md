# HM Custom Meta Boxes for WordPress

Custom Meta Boxes is a framework for easily adding custom fields  to the WordPress post edit page.

It includes several field types including WYSIWYG, media upload and dates ([see wiki for a full list](https://github.com/humanmade/Custom-Meta-Boxes/wiki)). It also supports repeatable and grouped fields.

This project is aimed at developers and is easily extended and customised. It takes a highly modular, Object Orientated approach, with each field as an extension of the CMB_Field abstract class.

The framework also features a basic layout engine for fields, allowing you to align fields to a simple 12 column grid.
